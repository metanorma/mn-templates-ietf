                  A Minimal Internet-Draft In AsciiRFC

Abstract

   This document provides a template on how to author (or migrate!) a
   new Internet-Draft / RFC in the AsciiRFC format.

Note

   This template requires usage of the Metanorma toolchain and the
   metanorma-ietf Ruby gem.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on 9 March 2023.

1.  Introduction

   AsciiRFC [I-D.ribose-asciirfc] is an extremely simple way to author
   Internet-Drafts and RFCs without needing to manually craft RFC XML
   conforming to [RFC7991].

   This is a template specifically made for authors to easily start with
   creating an Internet-Draft conforming to [RFC7991] and submittable to
   the IETF datatracker.

2.  Terms and definitions

   No terms and definitions are listed in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "*NOT RECOMMENDED*", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document also refers to the following terms and definitions:

   AsciiRFC  an AsciiDoc-derived syntax used for authoring RFCs and
      Internet-Drafts, as defined in [I-D.ribose-asciirfc].

3.  Symbols And Abbreviations

   ADRFC  abbreviated form of _AsciiRFC_

4.  Main content

   This is where you place the main content, and the following serves as
   a placeholder for your text.

   Subsections are used here for demonstration purposes.

4.1.  Getting started

   The Metanorma and RFC toolchains MUST be available locally to build
   this document template.

4.1.1.  Metanorma toolchain

   You will need to have:

   1.  Ruby: for running Metanorma

   a.  metanorma-cli gem: for the Metanorma command-line interface

   b.  metanorma-ietf gem: for converting AsciiRFC into XML RFC (v2 or
       v3)

4.1.2.  XML RFC toolchain

   You will need to have:

   1.  Python: for running xml2rfc

       a.  xml2rfc: for converting RFC XML (v2 or v3) into TXT

       b.  idnits: for submission preflight

4.2.  Referencing external content

   *  This is a published RFC [RFC7253]

   *  This is an Internet-Draft [I-D.ribose-asciirfc]

   *  This is an external reference [RNP]

4.3.  Code snippets

   Code snippets should be wrapped with <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS>
   blocks, as required by the IETF Trust Legal Provisions (TLP) 4 parens
   [IETF.TLP] specified in [RFC5378].

5.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations should be placed here.

   As described in Section 4 (here's how you refer a local anchor),
   local tools have to be installed before the document template can be
   built.

   Running of these local tools MAY produce unintended side effects that
   impact security.  For example

                 +=================+====================+
                 | Security issue  | Discussed in       |
                 +=================+====================+
                 | Confidentiality | 2.1.1 of [RFC3552] |
                 +=================+--------------------+
                 | Data Integrity  | 2.1.2 of [RFC3552] |
                 +=================+--------------------+
                 | Non-Repudiation | 2.2 of [RFC3552]   |
                 +=================+--------------------+

                                 Table 1

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action by IANA.

   But if it does, such as proposing changes to IANA registries, please
   include them here.

7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank their families.
