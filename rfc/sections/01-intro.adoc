== Introduction

AsciiRFC <<I-D.ribose-asciirfc>> is an extremely simple way to
author Internet-Drafts and RFCs without needing to manually
craft RFC XML conforming to <<RFC7991>>.

This is a template specifically made for authors to easily
start with creating an Internet-Draft conforming to <<RFC7991>>
and submittable to the IETF datatracker.
